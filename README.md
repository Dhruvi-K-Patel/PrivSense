## Dataset  
- **Source**: AOL Web Query Data (2006)  
- **Size**: 20 million queries from 650,000 users over three months  
- **Fields**:  
  - AnonID (Anonymous User ID)  
  - Query (Search term)  
  - QueryTime (Timestamp)  
  - ItemRank (Rank of clicked item)  
  - ClickURL (Clicked result)

## Privacy and Security Techniques  
QueryGuard employs **semantic similarity-based clustering (SSC)** and **K-anonymity** to anonymize query logs while preserving data usability.  

- **Semantic Similarity-Based Clustering**  
  - Uses **BERT embeddings** to measure similarity between queries.  
  - Groups queries into clusters using **K-Means clustering**.  

- **K-Anonymity**  
  - Ensures each query cluster is indistinguishable from at least **k-1 other clusters**.  
  - Uses **lossless generalization (LG)** and **information loss metrics** to evaluate anonymization effectiveness.

## Implementation  

### K-Means Clustering  
1. **Setup and Installations**  
   - Install necessary libraries (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `torch`, `transformers`).  
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load dataset using `pandas`.  
   - Apply **BERT-based text vectorization** for embedding queries.  
3. **Clustering**  
   - Normalize embeddings and apply **K-Means clustering**.  
4. **Output Storage**  
   - Save clustered data to an **Excel file** for analysis.  

### K-Anonymity  
1. **Generalization of Query Time**  
   - Convert timestamps to **Year-Month format** to reduce precision.  
2. **Cluster Naming**  
   - Assign **semantic labels** to clusters.  
3. **K-Anonymity Application**  
   - Ensure each cluster has at least `k=5` similar records.  
4. **Utility Metrics**  
   - Compute **distortion (0.58)** and **precision (0.42)** to assess data retention.  

---

## Testing and Results  
- **Performance**: Achieves **0.85 similarity score** in clustering.  
- **Privacy Protection**: Effectively reduces re-identification risks.  
- **Scalability**: Supports large datasets with **minimal computational overhead**.  
- **User Feedback**: Highly rated for usability and privacy balance.  

---

## Conclusion  
QueryGuard successfully anonymizes web search data while maintaining analytical value. Future improvements could include **DBScan clustering** and **differential privacy** to further enhance security and utility.
